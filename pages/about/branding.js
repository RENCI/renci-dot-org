        The elements below are used to create the core and expanded visual
        identity of RENCI. Reference each section below to learn more about
        proper usage and application in order to ensure the brand is applied
        consistently across all branded materials.

      <Section title="RENCI Logo">
        <Typography paragraph>
          The RENCI logo is the bedrock of our visual identity. This logo should
          be used on all deliverable materials. Consistent use of the RENCI logo
          will enhance recognition by all audiences. For light backgrounds, the
          primary logo uses RENCI blue (#00758D) for the r, e, i, and the comet
          above the i, and black (#231F20) for the n and c. Solid black and
          RENCI blue are acceptable in certain cases. For dark backgrounds, the
          secondary logo uses RENCI blue (#00758D) for the r, e, i, and the
          comet above the i, and white (#FFFFFF) for the n and c. Solid white is
          acceptable in certain cases.

            The logo must be reproduced from high-resolution digital artwork.
          </li>
          <li>
            As the primary visual identity for RENCI, the logo must appear on
            all communications, including brochures, stationary, business cards,
            and websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            The logo may not be reconstructed or altered in any way. This
            prohibition includes, but is not restricted to, type, color, comet,
            outlines and embellishments. Do not create secondary logos, as this
            confuses the audiences and hinders our purpose of creating a
            consistent, reinforcing identity.

        <Typography paragraph>
          To ensure the integrity and visual impact of the logo, the appropriate
          “clear space” must be maintained on all sides. Specifically, where “x”
          is equal to the height of the RENCI logo, there must be a minimum of
          1/2 the distance “x” between the outside edge of the logo and any
          other page element, including the edge of the page.

        <Typography paragraph>
          The RENCI comet element can only be 3 colors: white (#FFFFFF), black
          (#231F20), or RENCI blue (#00758D).

          The RENCI brand uses both a primary and secondary color palette. The
          primary color palette should be used predominantly on materials, while
          the secondary color palette should be used sparingly as accents to
          complement the primary palette. RENCI blue (#00758D) is the main color
          of RENCI and must be used at least 10% on all designs.
